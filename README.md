# Gate-Entry-Management-System--Database-System
he Gate Entry Management System is a software application that automates the process of managing the entry and exit of vehicles and people at a gate. The system allows administrators to create and manage user profiles for the gate entry/exit process. This includes features for user authentication and password reset to ensure the security of the system. You can view the final documentation in **'Gate-Entry-Management-System-Database-Systems/DBS_project_documentation.pdf'** and access the ER Diagram in **'Gate-Entry-Management-System-Database-Systems/ER Diagram.png'**.

Vehicle owners can register their vehicles with the system, and the gate authority can verify the registration details and record entry and exit times. The system provides reports and analytics on key metrics such as peak hours, vehicle types, and gate utilization. This information helps administrators to optimize gate management and improve the overall efficiency of the system.

The Gate Entry Management System is an important tool for organizations that need to manage large volumes of people and vehicles at entry and exit points. The system improves security, streamlines the entry/exit process, and provides valuable data and insights that can be used to optimize gate management. Overall, the Gate Entry Management System is a critical component of modern gate management systems and helps organizations to improve their overall operational efficiency.

The project includes a python code file with a menu-driven approach in the terminal. Also included are the ER diagrams, the relational schema and the documentation for the project. This was a part of our CS F211 Database System course at BITS Pilani, Pilani.
